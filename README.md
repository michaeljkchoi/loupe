Loupe
=====
Loupe is a Chrome extension that replaces the new tabs page.  Loupe will showcase Flickr's most interesting photos of the day as well as show the current date and time.  Inspiration came from [Rainfall's Currently extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/currently/ojhmphdkpgbibohbnpbfiefkgieacjmh).
